Linked lists can be stored anywhere in memory (linked addresses in memory).
Linked lists are great in situations where data needs to be read sequentially, but if there is a need to move back and forth, it is better not to use them.
Arrays are suitable for reading in random order.

The position of an element === index.
There are two types of access - random and sequential.
Array - random, list - sequential.
O(n) means that you accessed each element of the list once.

Selection sort O(n2).

// Sort Selection
var sortPeople = function(names, heights) {
    const n = names.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    let maxIdx = i;

    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (heights[j] > heights[maxIdx]) {
        maxIdx = j;
      }
    }
    [names[i], names[maxIdx]] = [names[maxIdx], names[i]];
    [heights[i], heights[maxIdx]] = [heights[maxIdx], heights[i]];
  }

  return names;

};
