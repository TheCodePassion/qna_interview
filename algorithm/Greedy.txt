A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
In many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, but a greedy heuristic can yield locally optimal solutions 
that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let maxArea = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    const width = right - left;
    const minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    const area = width * minHeight;
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return maxArea;
