1. What is the difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?

Pseudo-classes are used to select elements based on their state or user actions. For example, in the CSS rule "a:hover { color: red; }", the pseudo-class ":hover" 
selects the "a" element when it is being hovered over by the user. On the other hand, pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of elements. 
For example, in the CSS rule "p::before { content: 'Hello, '; font-weight: bold; }", the pseudo-element "::before" adds content before the content of each "p" element.

2. How to use and what is the difference between map and filter in React?

The map() method applies a specified function to each element of an array and creates a new array with the results.
It returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original one.

The filter() method creates a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the filter function returns true. For example:
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);

You can combine them

3. What are states in React?

In React, states are objects that contain data managed by a component. They are used to store and manage mutable values that can affect the component's rendering and behavior.

4. Difference between class components and functional components?

In short, class components are considered legacy.

5. What are props in React and how do they differ from states?

Props are for passing, states are for receiving.
Props are for passing, states are for receiving.
Props are for passing, states are for receiving.

6. What is Inline Conditional Expression?

Its also known as the conditional or ternary operator

7. What is Event Handling?

Event handling in React is the process of attaching functionality or logic to events that occur within React components. 
When a specific event, such as a click on an element or form submission, occurs, React invokes the corresponding callback function that you have defined. 
In this function, you can perform the necessary operations, update the component's state, or interact with other components. 
Event handling in React is done through attributes with names corresponding to the events, such as onClick for the click event or onChange for the value change event.

8. What are keys in React?

Keys in React are special attributes used to identify unique elements in a list of components when they are rendered or updated.
Either an ID or an index can be used as keys in the map callback.

9. What is dynamic Inputs in React?

Dynamic Inputs in React refer to the ability to create or manage dynamically changing or variable input fields in React components. 
Dynamic Inputs allow users to add, remove, or modify input fields in a form or other interactive components as needed. Essentially, it is just input into a form.

10. CSS Styles in React (how can they be implemented or what options are there?) 

In a separate file, in the same file, directly in the tag.

11. How is a CSS file different from a module.css?

CSS module files are an approach or methodology used to organize styles in React and other modern JavaScript frameworks.
In CSS Modules, each CSS file is treated as a separate module with its own namespace. 
This isolates styles and prevents naming conflicts between different components. Breaking CSS into modules is similar to breaking components.

12. What is the difference between Uncontrolled and Controlled components in React?

Controlled components take their current value as props. Uncontrolled components use onClick, Controlled components use onChange.
