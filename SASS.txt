Note: Watch Sass (by Ritwick Dey) is required for SASS!

The main difference between SCSS and SASS lies in their syntax. SASS uses a significantly more compact syntax without curly braces and semicolons. 
In SCSS, the syntax is more similar to regular CSS with curly braces and semicolons. SCSS appeared later than SASS.

SCSS is more fashionable and uses braces (familiar).

Modular approach.
Variables (appeared before CSS).
Nested styles for children.
MIXIN - reusable style components that can accept variables (dynamic + DRY).
Extend - inheritance (static). Placeholder classes marked with the % symbol.
Mathematical operators like calc can be used with variables.
