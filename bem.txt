BEM, which stands for Block-Element-Modifier, is a popular methodology for organizing and structuring CSS code in web development. 
It provides a systematic approach to naming classes and defining relationships between elements in HTML and CSS.

The key concept of BEM is to break down the user interface into separate components called blocks, which are self-contained and reusable. 
Each block represents a distinct section or module on the webpage. Blocks are given unique names that describe their purpose or functionality.

Inside each block, there are elements, which are the individual parts that make up the block. 
Elements are named in relation to their parent block and are separated by a double underscore (__).

Modifiers are used to modify the appearance or behavior of blocks or elements. Modifiers enable different variations of a block or element without duplicating CSS code.
They are denoted by double hyphens (--).

By using BEM, developers can create modular and maintainable CSS code that is easy to understand, navigate, and modify. 
The naming conventions and clear structure provided by BEM help in reducing conflicts, improving collaboration, and enhancing the scalability of CSS projects.
